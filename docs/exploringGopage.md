# Exploring GoPage

While GoPage is obviously split up into its separate pages there are two Universal elements to every page.

### Header

The Header contains three sections with the Settings Gear Icon in the Top Left that will take you to the Settings page as long as that isn't the current page you are on.

The Header contains three sections:

* The Settings Gear Icon in the top left that will take you to the Settings page as long as that is not your current page.

* GoPage Banner, a Banner indicating the service currently being used, that will bring you to the Home Page as long as that is not your current page.

* Clock, a simple clock updating every section that will show the current date and time in your current locale.

### Footer

At the bottom of the page is a simple Footer containing links to this Repo or a link to help contribute to this repo.

## HomePage

The Homepage is the obvious landing or entry point into GoPage, Having a simple button to create a new Link Item, a Category Selector and your current Link Items.

* The Category Selector will get all of the declared Categories in your different Link Items and show them as tab-able Items, meaning you can click each one to show only Link Items belonging to that category for easy searching.

* Each Link Item will get its own small box, showing the Friendly Name, you've attributed and the data from any Plugins Attached. With an edit and delete button in each bottom corner.

## Settings Page

The Settings Page is a simple way to view data about your installation, under the Summary Section as well as containing a Tools Section.
